    "- **Year**: $y \\in [1, Y]$\n",
    "- **Fleet**: $g \\in [1, G]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we ask what will be measured (and therefore provide our fit). \n",
    "- **Total Catch Weight**: $Y_{a,y,g}$ (note this is per age group and year as well)\n",
    "- **Catch Proportions by Fleet**: $P_{a,y,g}$\n",
    "- **Indices of Abundance**: $I_{y,g}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get total catch weight and catch proportions we need to know the catch. This is going to come from an equation familiar to us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{a,y,g}=\\frac{F_{a,y,g}}{Z_{a,y}}N_{a,y}(1 - e^{-Z_{a,y}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get at how to compute these components in a moment but let's just quickly capture how these lead to our measurables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{a,y,g}=C_{a,y,g}W_{a,y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_{a,y}$ is the weight of an individual fish in age $a$ and year $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{a,y,g}=\\frac{C_{a,y,g}}{\\sum_a C_{a,y,g}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue diving into how to compute catch. \n",
    "\n",
    "So first what is $F_{a,y,g}$? For the fleet as a whole there is a fishing mortality for that year $F_{y,g}$ and then there is a selectivity $S_{a,y,g}$ from which we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{a,y,g}=S_{a,y,g}F_{y,g}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all fleets we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{a,y}=\\sum_g F_{a,y,g}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z_{a,y}=F_{a,y} + M_{a,y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can talk to the abundance index as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I=q_{y,g}\\sum_a S_{a,y,g}N^{*}_{a,y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q_{y,g}$ is the catchability coefficient and * above $N_{a,y}$ just indicates that it could be count or weight depending on the kind of index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright if you've been following along you'll note that the $N_{a,y}$ are just floating around and we haven't really talked about how to compute them. Obviously if $N_{a-1, y-1}$ is known then we have for $a < A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{a,y}=N_{a-1,y-1}e^{-Z_{a-1,y-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no real maximum age for these fish age $A$ is really just a bucket for every $a>=A$. Therefore we have to include the growth from age class $A$ to itself:\n",

    "$$N_{A,y}=N_{A-1,y-1}e^{-Z_{A-1,y-1}}+N_{A, y-1}e^{-Z_{A,y-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This however still doesn't give us a sense of either what the $N_{1,y}$ (recruitment) sizes should be or how to compute the first year $N_{a,y}$ from which we will forward propogate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ASAP the following assumptions are made then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{1, y}=e^{\\mu_y}\\bar{N_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_y$ is a stochastic term and $\\bar{N_1}$ is some kind of average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for the $N_{a,1}$ it's assumed that the population is an equilibrium state - i.e. that the $Z_{a,1}$ have held constant for a long time. So for $a<A$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{a,1}=e^{\\psi_a}N_{1,1}\\prod_{i=1}^{a-1} e^{-Z_{i,1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given we're in an equilibrium position we can take our equation for $a=A$ above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{A,1}=N_{A-1,1}e^{-Z_{A-1,1}}+N_{A, 1}e^{-Z_{A,1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{A,1}=e^{\\psi_A}\\frac{N_{1,1}\\prod_{i=1}^{A-1} e^{-Z_{i,1}}}{1-e^{-Z_{A,1}}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Big difference between this and VPA is it puts constraints on how much the gear selectivity and recruitment can move whereas VPA allowed all that to be free and directly calculated from the catches and initial mortality. This then doesn't solve recursively but actually does an optimization fit instead in order to add constraints beyond the model equations themselves.\n",
